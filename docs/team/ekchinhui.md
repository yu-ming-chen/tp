## Project: NUSave

NUSave is a desktop budgeting application used to manage an individual's budgets and expenses. 
NUSave can hold multiple budgets, of which each budget holds multiple expenditures. 
The user interacts with it using a command line interface (CLI), and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. 
It is written in Java, and has about 10,000 LoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project:
- **Feature**: Added ability to render both budgets and expenditures in the GUI of NUSave.
    - Justification: This is a core feature that allows the display of both budgets and expenditures
    using `open` and `close` commands. This builds upon the original implementation of AB3 using the
    ObservableList. The challenge in implementation was in encapsulating the `Budget` and `Expenditure`
    classes with little dependency on the UI classes.
    
- **Feature**: Change implementation of storage to store budgets and expenditures.
    - Justification: This feature is necessary to store budget and expenditure data
    to be accessed in subsequent use of the application. Since there is an additional
    layer of data compared to AB3, a deep understanding of the original implementation
    was necessary to implement this feature.
    
- **Feature**: Added ability to find and list expenditures in NUSave.
    - What it does: `find` command allows users to be able to filter specific expenditures
    in the current budget which matches the input search term. `list` command allows users
    to display all expenditures within the current budget.
    - Justification: This feature allows the user to be able to quickly retrieve
    information about an expenditure especially if there are many expenditure entries.

#### 5.2.4. Finding budgets: `find`
(Contributed by Chin Hui)

Format: `find KEYWORD`

 Prefix | Parameters | Requirement | Comments
 ------ | ---------- | ----------- | --------
 \-     |  `KEYWORD` | Required    | Keyword to be used for searching

You can use this command to find budgets whose names contain the given `KEYWORD`.

When you find budgets, the list view will filter to only display budgets whose names contains the given `KEYWORD`.

 > 📕 The filter is case-insensitive.
 >
 > 📕 If no budgets are displayed, it means that none of the budgets matches your search term. 
 > 
 > 📕 You can use the [list budgets command](#525-listing-budgets-list) to display all budgets again.

✏️ Example: `find Temasek Hall`

This will find all budgets with the keyword 'Temasek Hall' in the name of the budget as seen in Figure 5.2.4.1 below:

### 3.1. Architecture

Figure 3.1.1: Architecture Diagram of NUSave components.

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the application.

Given below is a quick overview of each component:

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`] and [`MainApp`].
It has two primary responsibilities:
* At launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the application consists of five components:

1. [**`UI`**](#ui-component): Handles the UI of the application.
1. [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): Executes the commands.
1. [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the application in memory.
1. [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.
1. [**`State`**](#state-componenet): Remembers the current state of the application.

For each of the five components:

* Its API is defined in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Its functionality is exposed using a concrete `{Component Name} Manager` class which implements the corresponding API
`interface` mentioned in the previous point.
    - For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality
    using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

Figure 3.1.3: Sequence Diagram of component interactions for `delete 1` command used to delete a budget.

The ***Sequence Diagram*** given above shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user
issues the command `delete 1`.

#### 3.2.3. Model Component
(Contributed by Chin Hui)
![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)
Figure 3.4.1: Structure of the model component.

**API** : `Model.java`

The `Model`:

* Stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences.
* Stores a `Nusave` object that encapsulates `Budget` and `Expenditure` data.
* Exposes an unmodifiable `FilteredList<Renderable>` 
that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so
that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* Does not depend on any of the other three components.
* `FilteredList` was used in favor of `ObservableList` to facilitate the find command implementation.
Now the list can be filtered based on a `Predicate`, allowing for more flexibility for other 
filtering extensions i.e. filter by number of expenditures.

The `Nusave`:

* Implements methods that interface with the `Budget` and `Expenditure` 
data following the "Tell, Don't Ask" Principle.
* Stores an `ObservableList<Renderable>` that is passed up to populate the `FilteredList<Renderable>`.
* Stores a `BudgetList` (wrapper class for a `List<Budget>`) as well to access `Expenditures` within a `Budget` since
`Expenditures` cannot be accessed through `ObservableList<Renderable>`.

The `Budget`:
* Implements the Renderable interface and can thus be stored in the FilteredList.
* Contains a `Name`, `Date`, `Optional<Threshold>` and a `List<Expenditure>`.

The `Expenditure`:
* Implements the Renderable interface and can thus be stored in the FilteredList.
* Contains a `Name`, `Date`, `Price` and `Set<Tag>`.
